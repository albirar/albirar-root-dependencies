## Workflow and Git

All [Albirar](https://albirar.cat albirar) projects uses the [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow "GitFlow workflow")

This parent pom includes a fully configured [jgit-flow-plugin](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/jgit-flow/wiki/Home "jgit-flow plugin") to enforce the use of git workflow through maven.
